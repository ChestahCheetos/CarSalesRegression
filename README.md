# Car Sales Regression

This is an algorithm designed to estimate a car's sale price given a small handful of features.  The main purpose of this project was to learn about how to effectively utilize pipelines when building a model.

The notebook is diveded into sections detailing the actions being taken.

The notebook imports the data from ZeroToMastery's github, which is a course I took in the past.
